Project Description :

Goal: To predict the win probability of a team by giving out the winning percentages of both the teams.

The database will include all the information about the players playing, their individual ranking, team ranking, their historic performances and prediction
for how the match will play out and more, with a conclusion and the main focus being on who will win the upcomimg match.

Strategy:

We are planning to web scrape the ICCâ€™s website to extract data. Using this data we will create the database for our prediction system.

Outcome:

A solidified asset vault as a data set that is freely accessible on GitHub. This will be a guide for how to utilize the data set and 
a definite walkthrough toward the undertaking's end.
